        npx react-native init AwesomeProject
        cd /AwesomeProject

        npx run-ios or npx react-native run-ios (to run the ios app)

### Android permission Access and Camera Depedence Importing 

In you Project you should add these two  "VIBRATION , CAMERA"  permission to your AndroidManifest.xml. Its found in you Project path 
         
	                           PATH : android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml

                                                ...
                                           missingDimensionStrategy 'react-native-camera', 'general'
                                            }
